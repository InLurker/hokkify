## Hokkien honorifics made easy

Hokkify is a simple and fun app designed to help children learn about Hokkien honorifics. The app uses an explorable family tree to teach children about the relationships between different family members and the honorifics used to address them. The app is built using SwiftUI and AVFoundation, and uses phonetic text with the Tai Lo Hokkien Romanization System.

### Installation

To run Hokkify, you can either:

- Open the SwiftPM file in Xcode on the latest macOS version.
- Open the Swift Playground file in the Swift Playgrounds app on macOS or iPadOS.

### Usage

When you open the Hokkify app, you'll see an explorable family tree. Click on any family member to learn about their relationship to other family members and the honorifics used to address them. The app uses phonetic text with the Tai Lo Hokkien Romanization System, so children can learn the correct pronunciation of each honorific.

Hokkify uses images from [irasutoya](https://www.irasutoya.com "irasutoya") and audio from [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com "Zapsplat"). I would like to personally thank both platforms for providing the resources to create this app.
